## About Me

**Jaehwan Jeong** is a Ph.D. student at **<span style="color:#A41E34">Korea University</span>**, advised by [Prof. Sangpil Kim](https://kuaicv.com). He previously researched Diffusion-based **Generative models** and **AI Safety** for deepfake protection. Currently, he is a Visiting Graduate Researcher at the **<span style="color:#2774AE">University of California, Los Angeles</span> (UCLA)**
, advised by [Prof. M. Khalid Jawed](https://structures.computer). He leads the Smart Farm Project, driving end-to-end development from mechanical machining and system integration to software, AI, and field operations. His research focuses on practical, **Field-centric Rrobotics** leveraging <u>3D Reconstruction</u>, emphasizing <u>UGV Autonomy</u>, <u>Robotic Arm Manipulation</u> for object handling, and <u>Robust Perception</u> under real-world conditions.
